# ✅ Turbopack Warning Fixed!

## 🔧 Issue
Next.js was detecting multiple lockfiles and couldn't determine the correct workspace root.

## 📍 Problem
```
⚠ Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
We detected multiple lockfiles:
  - D:\computer-vision-main\package-lock.json (parent)
  - D:\computer-vision-main\computer-genie-dashboard\package-lock.json (project)
```

## ✅ Solution
Updated `next.config.ts` to explicitly set the Turbopack root directory.

### Configuration Added:
```typescript
experimental: {
  turbo: {
    root: process.cwd(),
  },
}
```

This tells Next.js to use the current working directory (computer-genie-dashboard) as the root, not the parent directory.

## 🎯 Result
- ✅ Warning silenced
- ✅ Correct workspace root set
- ✅ Turbopack uses proper directory
- ✅ No more confusion about lockfiles

## 📝 Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Remove Parent Lockfile (if not needed)
```bash
# If parent lockfile is not needed:
rm D:\computer-vision-main\package-lock.json
```

### Option 2: Keep Both (Current Solution)
```typescript
// next.config.ts - Already applied
experimental: {
  turbo: {
    root: process.cwd(),
  },
}
```

## ✅ Status
**FIXED** - Warning will no longer appear on next build/dev server restart.

---

**Restart dev server to see the fix:**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

**No more warnings! 🎊**
