## Troubleshooting

### "OCR not available" warning
This is normal! The vision agent works without OCR, but you can install Tesseract for text extraction:
- Windows: Download from [Tesseract releases](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
- macOS: `brew install tesseract`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`

### Command not found
Make sure you're in the right directory and have installed the package:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Permission errors
On macOS/Linux, you might need to grant screen recording permissions for the vision agent.

## Need More Help?
